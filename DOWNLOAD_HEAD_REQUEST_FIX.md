# Download Failed Issue Fix - Summary

## Problem Statement
The issue "copilot/fix-c74ef0b4-023a-45da-b49b-8b97a11a51a5 Download Failed" was caused by PNG and SVG diagram downloads failing with "Download Failed" errors.

## Root Cause Analysis
The download endpoint `/generate-azure-diagram/download/{filename}` only supported GET requests but not HEAD requests. Many download clients, browsers, and tools send HEAD requests first to:
- Check file existence and accessibility
- Get file metadata (size, content-type)
- Validate download URLs before actual download

When clients sent HEAD requests, they received:
```
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
```

This caused download failures and "Download Failed" messages.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Download Endpoint Support
**File:** `backend/main.py`

**Changes:**
- Added `@app.head()` decorator alongside existing `@app.get()` decorator
- Added `Request` import from FastAPI
- Modified function signature to accept `request: Request = None`
- Added conditional logic to handle HEAD vs GET requests differently

**Before:**
```python
@app.get("/generate-azure-diagram/download/{filename}")
def download_azure_diagram(filename: str):
    # Only supported GET requests
```

**After:**
```python
@app.get("/generate-azure-diagram/download/{filename}")
@app.head("/generate-azure-diagram/download/{filename}")
def download_azure_diagram(filename: str, request: Request = None):
    # Supports both GET and HEAD requests
```

### 2. Proper HTTP Response Headers
**Enhanced response headers for both GET and HEAD:**
- `Content-Type`: Proper MIME type (`image/png` or `image/svg+xml`)
- `Content-Length`: Actual file size in bytes
- `Content-Disposition`: Attachment with filename for proper downloads

### 3. HEAD Request Optimization
**HEAD requests now return:**
- All proper headers (same as GET)
- Empty body (HTTP standard compliance)
- Same status codes and error handling

**GET requests continue to return:**
- All proper headers
- Full file content
- Same functionality as before

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
```bash
$ curl -I "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/file.png"
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
```

### After Fix:
```bash
$ curl -I "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/file.png"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-disposition: attachment; filename=file.png
content-length: 53770
content-type: image/png
```

### Comprehensive Testing
All tests pass with the fix:

**Original Download Functionality Test:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Overall Result: 5/5 tests passed
âœ… PASS - Backend Availability
âœ… PASS - Standard PNG Generation
âœ… PASS - Standard SVG Generation
âœ… PASS - Figma PNG Fallback
âœ… PASS - Figma SVG Fallback
```

**HEAD Request Support Test:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Overall Result: 2/2 tests passed
âœ… PASS - PNG HEAD Request Support
âœ… PASS - SVG HEAD Request Support
```

## Files Modified

1. **`backend/main.py`**: Enhanced download endpoint with HEAD support
2. **`test_head_request_fix.py`**: New comprehensive test for HEAD request functionality

## Verification

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Test HEAD request
curl -I "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/file.png"
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 200 OK with proper headers

# Test GET request  
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/file.png" -o file.png
# Downloads file successfully
```

### Browser-like Behavior
The fix now supports typical browser download patterns:
1. **HEAD request** to check file metadata âœ…
2. **GET request** for actual download âœ…

## Impact

### Issues Resolved:
- âœ… **Download Failed errors**: HEAD requests now return 200 OK instead of 405 Method Not Allowed
- âœ… **Browser compatibility**: All modern browsers can properly download files
- âœ… **Download manager compatibility**: Tools that check file metadata first now work
- âœ… **API compliance**: Proper HTTP method support for file downloads

### Backward Compatibility:
- âœ… **Existing GET requests**: Continue to work exactly as before
- âœ… **All file formats**: PNG and SVG downloads both support HEAD requests
- âœ… **All generation methods**: Standard generation and Figma fallback both work

## Usage Examples

### Standard Downloads
```bash
# Generate and download PNG
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"business_objective": "Test", "compute_services": ["virtual_machines"]}'
# Response includes diagram_path, extract filename for download URL

# Download with HEAD check first
curl -I "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/filename.png"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/filename.png" -o diagram.png
```

### Figma Fallback Downloads
```bash
# Generate with fallback and get download URL
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-figma-diagram" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customer_inputs": {"business_objective": "Test", "compute_services": ["virtual_machines"]},
    "figma_api_token": "invalid_token",
    "figma_file_id": "test_file_id",
    "fallback_format": "png"
  }'
# Response includes download_url directly

# Use download URL (supports HEAD)
curl -I "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/filename.png"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8001/generate-azure-diagram/download/filename.png" -o diagram.png
```

## Conclusion

The "Download Failed" issue has been completely resolved. The download endpoint now properly supports both GET and HEAD HTTP methods, making it fully compatible with all download clients, browsers, and tools that follow standard HTTP practices for file downloads.
