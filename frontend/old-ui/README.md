# Simplified Azure Architecture Agent

This directory contains the old UI components that have been replaced with a simplified interface.

## Changes Made

- **old-demo.html**: Original HTML demo with multiple form fields
- **App.tsx.backup**: Original React App with complex form interface (40+ fields)

## New Implementation

The new simplified implementation consists of:
- **SimplifiedApp.tsx**: Single text input interface similar to eraser.io/diagramgpt
- **App.tsx**: Updated to use the simplified interface
- Enhanced backend endpoints for AI-powered analysis and generation

## Key Improvements

1. **User Experience**: Reduced from 40+ form fields to a single text input
2. **AI Integration**: Intelligent requirement analysis with human-in-the-loop clarification
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Only ask for details when needed
4. **Better UX Flow**: Similar to modern AI tools like eraser.io/diagramgpt
